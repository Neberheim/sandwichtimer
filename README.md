Use a CLI to set timers. Built for use with the [SandwichTimer Alfred Workflow](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/SandwichTimer).

## Usage
 
SandwichTimer was initally built to be a [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer controllable via CLI, but it can be used as a regular timer. While you can simply open the app and a Pomodoro cycle will start, itâ€™s meant to be called with its CLI:

```bash
SandwichTimer.app/Contents/MacOS/SandwichTimer "{{time_in_minutes}}"
```

Unlike most other timers, only the remaining minutes are shown, not the seconds.

Calling via CLI with no argument or `pomodoro` as the argument will initiate a repeating Pomodoro cycle, with actionable notifications at each stage.

Calling it with a number will initiate a timer. Its notification will continue firing until you quit it.

Calling it with `quit` as the argument will exit all running timers.

## Install

[Download the latest version](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/sandwichtimer/releases), or install via the [SandwichTimer Alfred Workflow](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/SandwichTimer).

## Development

Built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

`npm start` will call `electron main.js` and only then give the arguments. This means that while testing, an extra argument is passed on the command line. As such, the `process.argv` array positions need to be increased by one when testing, and be returned to their original state before building the app.

##### Commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run: `npm start`
- Build for macOS: `npm run build-macos`
- Build for all platforms: `npm run build`

Currently, only macOS is supported. I do not intend to officially support other platforms in the near future since I cannot consistently and reliably test on them, but am willing to add support if someone wants to collaborate in doing the legwork.
